# ESG Deal Screener

A Python-based analytics tool replicating the workflow of an impact-focused private equity or venture capital analyst. Using public ESG data, it classifies, scores, and visualises investment opportunities based on sustainability alignment, sector fit, and data recency. Though built on public company data, the structure mirrors a private-deal screening process and can be extended with startup data.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and normalises ESG datasets for structured analysis.
- **Sector Tagging (NLP):** Identifies sectors such as CleanTech, AgriTech, and HealthTech using keyword-based NLP.
- **Scoring System:** Combines ESG scores, recency, and sector match into an investment score.
- **Streamlit Dashboard:** Interactive filtering and visualisation.
- **Extensibility:** Adaptable to use APIs (e.g., Crunchbase) or advanced NLP models.
